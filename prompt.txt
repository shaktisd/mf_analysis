Create a python streamlit application to analyze mutual fund data.
Step 1. Given MF API to get fund details, cache the output from api and show a text box
where user can type the fund name and as user types show suggestion for fund names starting with the 
given search string. As user types change the suggestions accordingly.

API 1: https://api.mfapi.in/mf
Sample Output:
[
  {
    "schemeCode": 122640,
    "schemeName": "PPFAS Mutual Fund",
    "isinGrowth": null,
    "isinDivReinvestment": null
  },
  {
    "schemeCode": 100028,
    "schemeName": "Grindlays Super Saver Income Fund-GSSIF-Quaterly Dividend",
    "isinGrowth": null,
    "isinDivReinvestment": null
  },
  {
    "schemeCode": 100029,
    "schemeName": "Grindlays Super Saver Income Fund-GSSIF-Growth",
    "isinGrowth": null,
    "isinDivReinvestment": null
  }
]


Step 2. Once a fund name is selected in step 1, call API 2 to get fund details based on the select fund.
API 2 URL is created based on selected fund schemeCode as shown below

API 2 : https://api.mfapi.in/mf/<schemeCode>
Example API 2 : Fund selected in Step 1 = PPFAS Mutual Fund
API 2 URL :  https://api.mfapi.in/mf/122640

Step 3 : Make call to API 2 created in step 2 and show the fund details 
API 2 URL :  https://api.mfapi.in/mf/122640
API 2 output : 
{
  "meta": {
    "fund_house": "PPFAS Mutual Fund",
    "scheme_type": "360 ONE Mutual Fund",
    "scheme_category": "Formerly Known as IIFL Mutual Fund",
    "scheme_code": 122640,
    "scheme_name": "Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund - Regular Plan - Growth",
    "isin_growth": "INF879O01019",
    "isin_div_reinvestment": null
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "date": "13-03-2025",
      "nav": "76.38010"
    },
    {
      "date": "12-03-2025",
      "nav": "76.84980"
    },
    {
      "date": "11-03-2025",
      "nav": "76.57750"
    },
  ]
}

Step 4: Show graph of timeseries data of the fund along with fund details .
