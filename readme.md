I'll create a Python Streamlit application to analyze mutual fund data. Let's build this step-by-step with a focus on creating an interactive, user-friendly interface.

This Mutual Fund Analyzer application I've created follows your requirements and provides a comprehensive interface for analyzing mutual fund data. Let me explain the key components and how they fulfill each step:

### Step 1: Fund Search with Suggestions
I've implemented a search box that:
- Makes an API call to `https://api.mfapi.in/mf` to fetch all funds
- Caches this data using Streamlit's `@st.cache_data` decorator to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Filters fund suggestions as you type, showing funds whose names contain the search term
- Provides a dropdown selection of matching funds with their scheme codes

### Step 2 & 3: Fund Selection and Details
When a fund is selected:
- The application constructs the API URL with the selected scheme code (`https://api.mfapi.in/mf/<schemeCode>`)
- Makes the API call and retrieves detailed fund information
- Displays comprehensive fund metadata in a well-formatted table including:
  - Fund house
  - Scheme type and category
  - Scheme code
  - ISINs (for growth and dividend reinvestment if available)

### Step 4: Data Visualization and Analysis
For the selected fund, the application:
- Parses the historical NAV data from the API response
- Creates an interactive time series graph using Plotly Express
- Allows users to select different time periods (1 month, 3 months, 1 year, etc.)
- Calculates and displays key performance statistics:
  - Latest NAV value
  - Short-term returns (1-day, 1-week, 1-month)
  - Longer-term returns (1-year and total historical return)
- Provides an option to download the historical data as a CSV file

### Additional Features
I've also included some helpful features:
- Loading spinners for better user experience during API calls
- Error handling for failed API requests
- Responsive layout with columns for organized information display
- Session state management to maintain selected fund across interactions
- Pagination for viewing the historical data table

### How to Run the Application
To run this application, you'll need to:

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas requests plotly
```

2. Save the code to a file (e.g., `mf_analyzer.py`)

3. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run mf_analyzer.py
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser, allowing you to search for and analyze mutual funds with an intuitive interface.
